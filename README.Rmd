## Purpose

Package 'learnrbook' contains data in R objects and in foreign files, the R scripts used in examples and R code from all code chunks from the second edition of the book ***Learn R: As a Language*** by Pedro J. Aphalo, New York: Chapman and Hall/CRC, 2024, ISBN 9781032516998 (pbk); ISBN 9781032518435 (hbk); ISBN 9781003404187 (ebk); DOI [ 10.1201/9781003404187](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003404187) and also from the first edition of 2020, ISBN 9780367182533 (pbk); ISBN 9780367182557 (hbk); ISBN 9780429060342 (ebk); DOI [10.1201/9780429060342](https://doi.org/10.1201/9780429060342).

This package also exports as character vectors the names of the packages used in the book, so as to make it easier to install them.

## The book "Learn R: As a Language" 1ed and 2ed

Learning a computer language like R can be either frustrating, fun or boring. Having fun requires challenges that wake up the learner's curiosity but also provide an emotional reward for overcoming them. The book is designed so that it includes smaller and bigger challenges, in what I call playgrounds, in the hope that all readers will enjoy their path to R fluency. Fluency in the use of a language is a skill that is acquired through practice and exploration. For students and professionals in the biological sciences, humanities and many applied fields, recognizing the parallels between R and natural languages should help them feel at home with R. The approach I use is similar to that of a travel guide, encouraging exploration and describing the available alternatives and how to reach them. The intention is to guide the reader through the R landscape of 2024 and beyond.
