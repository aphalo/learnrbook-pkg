Package '**learnr**' comtains data and foreign files used in examples in the
book "Learn R ...as you learnt your mother tongue" by Pedro J. Aphalo (available 
at <https://leanpub.com/learnr>).  

In addition this package exports as character string vectors the names of the
packages used in the book, so as to make it easier to install them.

To install this R package from CRAN (not yet submitted!) use:

```{r}
install.packages("learnr")
```

To install the development version from the Git repository at Bitbucket, do
use:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aphalo/learnr-pkg")
```

Please, see the web site [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for
details and update notices. Other packages, aimed at easing photobiology-related
calculations including the quantification of biologically effective radiation in
meteorology are available at the same website.

The current release of '__learn__' is available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=learn) 
for R (>= 3.3.0).
